Big Display 3D printed with Strip Led WS2812 using Arduino DHT22 Temperature and Humidity

I based my project on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7xdRMfPbP8 

3D models and building instructions: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2977443 (I printed with size of 65% compared to original size of this model)
